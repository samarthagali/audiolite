# audiolite
A deep learning framework for audio compression and decompression
Traditional media compression methods face challenges in achieving optimal ratios without compromising quality, limiting adaptability to diverse content and network conditions. This GitHub project addresses these limitations by leveraging artificial intelligence to redefine image and audio compression, aiming for higher ratios, enhanced user experience, and eco-conscious practices in the digital age.
